## Long Quiz in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).
According to Amazon.com, Service Oriented Architecture is a method of software development that uses software components called services to create business applications. In my Opinion These can lessen the time spent in developing a system especially if the system will need services that can be used in every organizations. like for instance, you will develop a two system that will need a biometric scanner, this biometric scanner service will be used by both system. so that it can lessen the time spent on developing seperate system, knowing that it has the same function.

2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.
I think the characteristics that i see is it should be INTUITIVE what im trying to say is it should be easily accessible for every user who desire to use it. It must follow the right ethics of a service so that everyone would be able to comprehend it, the standards of every services should be followed.
second is it should have a SEPERATIONS OF CONCERN, SOA should not be always dependent on the outside resources, like users. to avoid disruptions to the service used by others

3. Define Microservices.
According to microservice.io The microservice architecture enables an organization to deliver large, complex applications rapidly, frequently, reliably and sustainably a necessity for competing and winning in todayâ€™s world.
this imply that 

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.
The first thing i noticed about the characteristic of Microservices is, it's CALIBRATED, for instance i want to develop a appointment system, microservices will breakdown each part of the system need like for instance consumer service, appointment service this will come the booking, what im trying to say is the services it offered where precise since it is made only for the specific application

5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.
I assume that their similarity is the purpose of them, they are both services which imply that they offer variation of services according to everyone needs.

Moreover, one thing i notice about the difference about these 2 is SOA is about SERVICE INTEGRATION and Microservices is SPECIFIC, why did i say this since SOA is used widely by different users who have the same desired service. in able to lessen the work and lessen of their workload, microservices offers a spevific services for a specific problem in your team or organization which is exclusive to all of you only inside the team.

6. Define Web Services.
According artoftesting.com, web services are meant for other application to be interacted with over the internet,
i remember the video we watch in Enterprise before about the api i think it has a connection in this since the video explain it in layman's term. 
in a restauant, the api is the menu and the waiter is the web service, of course the consumer is the client.
 the waiter which is the web service will take your order to the kitchen which is the server. 
the client can freely choose which web service he/she want to acknowledge in his/her desired website through api.

7. List and discuss the benefits of using Web Services.
The Benefits of using web services is its FLEXIBILITY, being able to use web service to any website or 
software without any restriction, one example of this is the api of Chatgpt AI, 
many student use this to to implement in their website whether it is text or for image. 
this emphasize the flexibility of this web service to be used by each websites without any restriction, your just going to have api key.
second benefits of web services is it NOT COSTLY to acquired, since if you are a programmer you will not start from scratch to develop a specific service in which it already have in web services.

8. List and discuss the characteristics of Web Services.
One of the best characteristic of Web Services are XML since the purpose of xml is to contain data that is readable for both human and machine,
 it gives the web service a comprehensive service that is tag-based structure that would be easy for every users specially programmers to understand 
Second is Web Services are mostly INDEPENDENT, one example of this is one of my classmates system implements AI api in the chatbot of their system.
 the api key used in their system. if there will come a time of updates in the AI their system would not be much of affected since it dont relies on ai solely. 
it can continue to function without requiring modifications unless there are changes to the API.

9. List and discuss the distinct roles in Web Services Architecture.
The roles in web services architecture are easy to comprehend. it is like a business layer where in it has a a service PROVIDER, CONSUMERS(REQUESTOR), BROKER the one who finds web service. 
now if we would relate it to the web services architecture. service provider is the one who made the service, it is the one who can offer a service to a requestor. 
requestor is the one who need to upgrade their web site by requesting specific type of service. and lastly is the broker serves as intermediary in both roles. 
it gives the requestor an knowledge on how to access the web service. 


10. List and discuss the Web Services Components.

in my opinion, SOAP is like a very sophisticated container for carrying information as it follows a strict protocol from one machine to
 another since it stated in the handouts that the sole purpose of it is to communicate, between each softwares. 
 It's like those multilayered mails that I write in, delicately close, and send around.
This technique ensures that the recipient always knows how to interpret and respond to the message placated withing. 
Essentially, SOAP allows to safely package and transfer messages across other applications or systems,
guaranteeing that the message is understood and clear when it gets there.
